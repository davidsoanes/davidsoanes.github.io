      the most. They were like those treats for me for which I was always
      looking forward to and couldn’t wait to start. It may not have very rational or logical answers to it - it just feels right
      and every time it happens it makes my hearts grow and I come back from
      every trip feeling a little bit better with more knowledge and with
      more love and appreciation for the world. I am the type of traveller
