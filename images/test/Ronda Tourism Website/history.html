        <h2>What makes Ronda special?</h2>
        <p>
          My favorite activity to look forward to is always when I can get on
          the train and go travelling - my holidays, weekends and every amount
          of time away from work were always the times I was looking forward to
          the most. They were like those treats for me for which I was always
          looking forward to and couldn’t wait to start. Why? Unfortunately I do
          not have very rational or logical answers to it - it just feels right
          and every time it happens it makes my heart grow and I come back from
          every trip feeling a little bit better with more knowledge and with
          more love and appreciation for the world. I am the type of traveller
          who likes to wander, learn and also relax during a trip.
        </p>
        <p>
          My favorite places to visit are smaller towns where I can explore
          streets or just relax in a coffee shop, order something simple and
          enjoy watching the world goes by. I also enjoy spending time close to
          nature, walking in forests, hiking, visiting national parks or just
          finding new places and following where the map takes me. I like that
          mix of travel while being always in close proximity to nature, it
          gives me that feeling of excitement of exploring and being close to
          nature makes me feel complete. I also enjoy visiting countries I have
          never visited bforebut at the same time I also enjoy coming back to
          the same places I visited before. It is enjoyable and educational
          seeing how they change over a time. They become more like my other
          homes which I get to understand better with every minute spent there.

        <h2>The Serrania</h2>

        <p>
          As my travels are my treats, I was always trying to choose the right
          accommodation which fits perfectly with what I need. Due to money
          constraints I usually compromised on some things I was looking for in
          accommodation but over time I decided that since it is my treat time I
          want it to be as free from concerns as possible so I started to look
          for more expensive accommodation hoping that it will tick all the
          boxes and at the same time I tried to save on other things.
        </p>
        <p>
          I don’t mind paying more for accommodation if I know it will provide
          what I need but unfortunately over time I noticed that it is not
          actually always happening. Not always but unfortunately quite often I
          came back from my trips with a few disappointing memories of my
          accommodation. These were not a big things, these were actually very
          easily avoidable or fixable issues but unfortunately either my
          requests were forgotten or badly handled or even sometimes just
          ignored.
        </p>
        <p>
          I would usually spend a good deal of time on choosing the right
          accommodation as it was a place where I would not only like to come
          back and have a good nights sleep but also relax while drinking a cup
          of tea or just sitting on the terrace or just popping in for a break
          from my sightseeing for a few minutes and relaxing before getting back
          to my adventures.
