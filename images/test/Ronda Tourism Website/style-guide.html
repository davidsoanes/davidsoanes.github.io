        <h2>Why I Travel:</h2>
        <p>
          My favorite activity to look forward to is always when I can get on
          the train and go travelling - my holidays, weekends and every amount
          of time away from work were always the times I was looking forward to
          the most. They were like those treats for me for which I was always
          looking forward to and couldn’t wait to start. Why? Unfortunately I do
          not have very rational or logical answers to it - it just feels right
          and every time it happens it makes my hearts grow and I come back from
          every trip feeling a little bit better with more knowledge and with
          more love and appreciation for the world. I am the type of traveller
          who likes to wander, learn and also relax during a trip.
